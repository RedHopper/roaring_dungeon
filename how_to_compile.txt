In order to compile the Roaring Dungeon game follow these steps:
1. Create a build folder in root directory using cmake CLI:
	# cmake -S . -B build
2. cd into build folder and actually build project:
	# cd build ; cmake --build .
3. Copy resulted roaring_dungion executable file into root folder. It is needed to provide executalbe with all texture and shader files
4. Enjoy!
